Using Random Forest to select the most relevant variables

PCA


List of Activities Still to be Completed:


Save the data into csv files

Save all visualisations to outputs folder

Output the story of the data with streamlit or dash as an interactive dashboard

stop the analysis at the end of the PCA outputs. save the rest of the file to begin the ML algorithms repo proper

Learn and apply markdown on this document and complete documentation and user guide

refactor and modularise code for performance
